# Replugged-Support-Info

I will never go out of my way to officially support Replugged. You can feel free to fork and redistribute your own version of my themes, so long as you respect the licenses. 

I do not like Replugged as a project fundamentally. It is a bitch to maintain themes on my end, and it would appear that some theme devs would agree. 

As far as I'm concerned and for the time being, only Vencord and BetterDiscord will receive my attention.

All of my themes are MIT or WTFPL, with only WinClassic being GPLv3 because it's a fork.
